activity$steps <- as.numeric(activity$steps)
attach(activity) # making the work easier
```
### Histogram thing, mean and median
```{r}
hist(steps) # still not sure, whether this is all we were supposed to plot...
```

### Mean and median
```{r}
mean(steps,na.rm=T)
median(steps,na.rm=T)
```

### Time series
```{r}
activity[,4]<-seq(1:17568)
colnames(activity)<-c( "steps","date", "interval", "interval2")
plot(activity$interval2, steps, type="l", xlab="5-minute interval")
```
